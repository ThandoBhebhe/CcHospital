# CcHospital
Hospital App build in Java uses JDBC for database connectivity and Swing for UI components.

JDBC Driver connects through port 3306. XAMPP used as local server, configure config files in XAMPP to use port 3306 (this might not be as necessary as this is the usually the default port) and start MySQL. On some older applications you might also need to start Apache.
The ConnectorJ used for this project is included in the project directory.
